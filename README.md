# Pig-Game

# --- HISTORY ---
# The game Pig was invented in 1945 by John Scarne. It's a simple dice game played by two people.

# --- GUIDE TO VARIABLES ---
# 1. "playersum" is your total sum. This total will be compared to the computer's (compsum) to determine who wins (see Rules).
# 2. "compsum" is the computer's total sum. This total will be compared to yours (playersum) to determine who wins (see Rules).
# 3. "playerturn" is your turn total. This total will reset after you hold or roll a 1 (see Rules).
# 4. "compturn" is the computer's turn total. This total will reset after the computer holds or rolls a 1 (see Rules).

# --- RULES ---
# Cues during your turn will appear to ask you whether you would like to roll, hold, etc. but here are some rules to help you :)

# Type GO to roll the dice
# - If you roll a 1, your turn total ("playerturn") becomes 0 and it is the opposite player's (in this case, the computer's) turn ("compturn")
# - If you roll any other number, it is added to your turn total.
# Now, you can choose to hold, which would mean your turn total is added to your final sum ("playersum") and your turn ends. 
# If you choose not to hold, it is still your turn, and you get to roll again.

# --- HOW TO WIN ---
# The first one to reach 100 or above with their total sum (playersum vs. compsum) wins.

# --- GUIDE TO COMPUTER TURN ---
# You will be playing against the computer. The computer will decide randomly whether to hold or not.
# The player (you) have the first turn.

# GOOD LUCK !!
